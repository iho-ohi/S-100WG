# S100-Schemas
S100 Edition 4.0.0 Schemas uploaded as ZIP file.  See accompanying README docx file for folder organization.

The May 2019 update adds the ID attribute to the generic exchange catalogue schema. It also adds exchange catalogue schemas for S-98, S-101, S-102, S-111, and S-127.

The S-100 Edition 4.0.0 Schemas <em>folder</em> in this branch is now obsolete and awaiting deletion.

Obsolete 4.0.0 schemas and folder proposed for deletion on May 5 2021, pending reconciliation of repositories. Until the reconciliation happens, see the repository at [IHO-S100WG/S100-Schemas](https://github.com/IHO-S100WG/S100-Schemas) for the Edition 4.0.0 schemas.

## Updated Portrayal schemas
The zip file S100_4_1_0_S100XSLTPR_20191115.zip contains the portrayal files from schemas/S100/4.0.0/S100XSLTPR/ with updates to four files implementing the changes approved at S-100 WG4 (See S-100WG4-4.6, 4.7, and 4.8 for descriptions of the updates). The other files in S100XSLTPR have not been changed in this zip but are included because some of the updated files have import or use dependencies on some of the unchanged files. The S-100 revision number for this zip has been incremented because the proposed changes are extensions to S-100 4.0.0.

Update (2021-05-05): These (4.1.0) portrayal schemas are probably now out of date. Pending reconciliation of repositories, the interim portrayal schemas for Edition 5.0.0 are also at [IHO-S100WG/S100-Schemas](https://github.com/IHO-S100WG/S100-Schemas).
